## AMZ paper
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05150.pdf <br>
**Description:** This paper is written by the AMZ team (won several driverless competitions). Their paper covers their entire software stack and all algorithms that they used to setup their system.  

## AMZ FSD resources
**Link:** https://github.com/AMZ-Driverless/fsd-resources <br>
**Description:** Readme page with a collection of resources collection by AMZ.

## AMZ Simulator
**Link:** https://github.com/AMZ-Driverless/fssim<br>
**Description:** Repo with their simulator. Implemented with ROS1 and gazebo.

## Filters
**Link:**  https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python <br>
**Description:** Filter will be needed to locate the car within a track. This resource covers a list of filters by providing code samples in jupyter notebooks.

## Object detectors
### Mask-RCNN
**Link:** https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN <br>
**Description:** One of the earliest object detection frameworks. Largely replace by object detector such as YOLO.

### YOLOv5
**Link:** https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5<br>
**Description:** The family of YOLO detectors were originally developed in the darknet framework. This repo however implements the latest iteration in Pytorch which is much more user friendly.

### EfficientDet
**Link:** https://github.com/rwightman/efficientdet-pytorch <br>
**Description:** Detection framework that offers different speed/accuracy trade-offs.

## Deep learning frameworks

### Pytorch
**Link:** https://pytorch.org/ <br>
**Description:** Highly flexible deep learning framework. The preferred choice for this project.

### Keras
**Link:** https://keras.io/ <br>
**Description:** DL framework aimed at making DL code easy.

### Tensorflow
**Link:** https://www.tensorflow.org/ <br>
**Description:** DL framework made for production use. Exists in two versions tf1 and tf2. tf1 is not user friendly while tf2 is not commonly used.

## Nvidia drive kit
**Link:** https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/drive-agx <br>
**Description:** Hardware that we might use.

## ROS (Robotic Operating System)
**Link:** https://www.ros.org/ <br>
**Description:** Framework commonly used for controlling robots.
